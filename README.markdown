# TDBadgedCell
TDBadgedCell grew out of the need for TableViewCell badges and the lack of them in iOS (see the [article explaining this on TUAW](http://www.tuaw.com/2010/01/07/iphone-devsugar-simple-table-badges/). Recently the project has been re-written in Swift and much simplified.

## Installation

Add this to your project using Swift Package Manager. In Xcode that is simply: File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency... and you're done. Alternative installations options are shown below for legacy projects.

### CocoaPods

If you are already using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), just add 'TDBadgedCell' to your `Podfile` then run `pod install`.

### Carthage

If you are already using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), just add to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "fulldecent/TDBadgedCell" ~> 0.1
```

Then run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `TDBadgedCell`.framework into your Xcode project.

***Note:*** *You can find the old Objective-C version on the [deprecated-objective-c branch](https://github.com/tmdvs/TDBadgedCell/tree/deprecated-objective-c)*.

To set the content of your badge (String) simply do:

```Swift
cell.badgeString = "Hello, World!"
```

You can set _badgeColor_ and _badgeColorHighlighted_ to modify the colour of the badges:

```Swift
cell.badgeColor = UIColor.orangeColor()
```

You can also specify a border radius and font size for your badges:

```Swift
cell.badgeRadius = 9;
cell.badgeFontSize = 18;
```

## Licence and that stuff
TDBadgedCell is a free to use class for everyone. I wrote it so people could have the badges Apple never provided us with. If you modify the source please share alike and if you think you've improved upon what I have written I recommend sending me a pull request.

**Please note:** If you are using TDBadgedCell in your project please make sure you leave credit where credit is due. Chances are I won't notice if you haven't left credit but karma willâ€¦
